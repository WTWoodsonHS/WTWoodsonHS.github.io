Conjectures about properties and relationships are developed inductively and then verified deductively. Students investigate non-Euclidean geometries, formal logic, and use deductive proofs to verify theorems. Calculators, computers, graphing utilities, dynamic geometry software, and other appropriate technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning.",
